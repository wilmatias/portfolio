### Option 2: GitHub + Vercel Dashboard

1. **Push to GitHub**

   git commit -m "Add Vite configuration for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import in Vercel**

## Important Notes

### Environment Variables
If you need to set environment variables (like EmailJS keys):

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add your variables

2. **In your code:**
   - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_VAR_NAME` to access them
   - Prefix with `VITE_` for client-side variables

### Custom Domain
- After deployment, you can add a custom domain in Vercel dashboard
- Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
- Add your domain and follow DNS configuration

### Performance Tips
- Your site is already optimized with Vite's build process
- Static assets are automatically cached
- Vercel provides global CDN automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails:**
   - Check `npm run build` works locally
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

2. **Assets not loading:**
   - Verify `base: './'` in `vite.config.js`
   - Check file paths are relative

3. **Vue not working:**
   - Ensure Vue is loaded via CDN in `index.html`
   - Check browser console for errors
